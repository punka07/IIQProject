****************************************
OVERVIEW OF RELEASE
****************************************

Version 4 of the consolidated Services Standard Deployment (SSD) contains a number of new
components, enhancements and fixes.


****************************************
NEW TO THIS RELEASE:
****************************************

SSB: 
    - Build Checks: a series of checks around the build process to alert the deployer to 
      common misconfigurations and deviations from best practices. The results of these 
      checks are written to a log file.  Checks in this release allow logging of the 
      following:
         - Unencrypted passwords in Application XML objects
         - Unencrypted passwords in iiq.properties files
         - Use of wildcard import statements in BeanShell code in XML files
         - Absence of code comments in Java source code
         - Presence of System.out statements in Java source code
         - XML files that do not conform to a given naming convention
      Deployers may also build their own build checks.
    - Automated deployment of any IdentityIQ plugins included with the build (for 
      IdentityIQ 7.1 and above).
    - New 'initial-build' target for performing a repeatable initial build of IdentityIQ 
      from scratch (MySQL, SQL Server).
    - New 'cleanWeb' target to remove all of the IdentityIQ application files and folders 
      from the application server.
    - New 'runSql' target to run arbitrary SQL scripts against the IdentityIQ database.         
    - Restructure and tidy up of some of the existing SSB targets.
    - Ability to define a different version of log4j.properties for each environment.
    - Configuration of IdentityIQ session timeout in the build. 
    - Updates to SSB User Guide.

SSF Tools:
    - Certification Exclusion Framework: simplifies the definition of exclusions in
      IdentityIQ certifications by replacing complex exclusion rules with logic maintained
      in a separate filter-driven configuration that is more intuitive.
    - Access Request Attachments: permits the upload of files as attachments during an 
      access request so that they can be viewed by the approver to aid in making an 
      approval decision or as background information.
    - Server-Specific Task Launcher: launches a task on a specified server or servers.
      Also allows a partitioned task to be executed across a specified group of servers.
    - Password Expiration Reminder: provides a mechanism to send notifications to users 
      via IdentityIQ when the passwords on their accounts in integrated target systems
      are about to expire. Can also generate a policy violation and perform additional
      custom steps when an account password has expired.

SSP Tools: 
    - Task Resulter: provides a simple screen to view the results of account aggregation 
      tasks, including information unavailable in the main Task Results page, such as 
      aggregation duration and speed (in records per second).  It is useful for measuring 
      performance of your account aggregations.

SST Tools:
    - SST JUnit IdentityIQ Helper: allows implementers to leverage the JUnit framework for
      unit testing an IdentityIQ implementation in an IDE.  The helper classes allow the 
      unit tester to easily access the SailPointContext and some of the functionality 
      of the IdentityIQ Console to reduce the time taken to implement unit tests.
    

Bugs fixed since SSD v3 GA

 - The SSB 'import' target was not prompting for authentication when the IdentityIQ
   username and password had been changed from the default.
 - The SSB environment-specific build.properties file naming convention did not match the 
   format used by other types of properties files.
 - The SSB Log4j Properties Updater was not handling non-alpha Logger variable names 
   correctly.
 - The SSB 'document' target was placing technical documentation in web-accessible folder.
   The documentation is now placed in doc/TechnicalConfig/ under the build folder.
 - Some SSB targets, including 'prepareCustomConfig' and 'import-custom' were not ignoring
   files listed in ignorefiles.properties.
 - In the SSF ProvisionProcessor Framework, the SP Provision Processor Sub workflow was 
   referencing an incorrect email template name for manual provisioning actions.
 - The Object Exporter noIdNameMap hidden option stopped working in IdentityIQ 7.1, giving
   an 'Unable to find ClassMapping for SailPointObject' error.
 - The Object Exporter reverse-tokenization feature produced unexpected results when blank
   or whitespace token values were present in the reverse-tokenization properties file.
 - The Enhanced Email Notifier produced a 'No serializer' error when running the Summary 
   Email Processor Task.

****************************************
NOTES
****************************************
SSF provisioning now runs in the background by default for all the SSF features, which
means provisioning will not happen until the next time the Perform Maintenance task runs.
This is the recommended setting to avoid identity locking conflicts during identity 
refreshes.

If you are currently using a version of the SSF features and frameworks from SSD v1.1 or
earlier there is no simple upgrade procedure for these components.  An upgrade would be a
more in-depth exercise carried out by a trained and experienced IdentityIQ implementer.
